  abstract = {Much effort has been directed at algorithms for obtaining the highest probability (MAP) configuration in probabilistic (random field) models. In many situations, one could benefit from additional high-probability solutions. Current methods for computing the M most probable configurations produce solutions that tend to be very similar to the MAP solution and each other. This is often an undesirable property. In this paper we propose an algorithm for the Diverse M-Best problem, which involves finding a diverse set of highly probable solutions under a discrete probabilistic model. Given a dissimilarity function measuring closeness of two solutions, our formulation involves maximizing a linear combination of the probability and dissimilarity to previous solutions. Our formulation generalizes the M-Best MAP problem and we show that for certain families of dissimilarity functions we can guarantee that these solutions can be found as easily as the MAP solution.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic topic models, have been widely deployed for various applications such as learning disease or tissue subtypes. Yet, learning the parameters of such models is usually an ill-posed problem and may result in losing valuable information about disease severity. A common approach is to add a discriminative loss term to the generative model’s loss in order to learn a representation that is also predictive of disease severity. However, finding a balance between these two losses is not straightforward. We propose an alternative way in this paper. We develop a framework which allows for incorporating external covariates into the generative model’s approximate posterior. These covariates can have more discriminative power for disease severity compared to the representation that we extract from the posterior distribution. For instance, they can be features extracted from a neural network which predicts disease severity from CT images. Effectively, we enforce the generative model’s approximate posterior to reside in the subspace of these discriminative covariates. We illustrate our method’s application on a large-scale lung CT study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a highly heterogeneous disease. We aim at identifying tissue subtypes by using a variant of topic model as a generative model. We quantitatively evaluate the predictive performance of the inferred subtypes and demonstrate that our method outperforms or performs on par with some reasonable baselines. We also show that some of the discovered subtypes are correlated with genetic measurements, suggesting that the identified subtypes may characterize the disease’s underlying etiology.},

  abstract = {The Normalizing Flow (NF) models a general probability density by estimating an invertible transformation applied on samples drawn from a known distribution. We introduce a new type of NF, called Deep Diffeomorphic Normalizing Flow (DDNF). A diffeomorphic flow is an invertible function where both the function and its inverse are smooth. We construct the flow using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) governed by a time-varying smooth vector field. We use a neural network to parametrize the smooth vector field and a recursive neural network (RNN) for approximating the solution of the ODE. Each cell in the RNN is a residual network implementing one Euler integration step. The architecture of our flow enables efficient likelihood evaluation, straightforward flow inversion, and results in highly flexible density estimation. An end-to-end trained DDNF achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods on a suite of density estimation and variational inference tasks. Finally, our method brings concepts from Riemannian geometry that, we believe, can open a new research direction for neural density estimation.},

  abstract = {Semantic image segmentation is an important computer vision task that is difficult because it consists of both recognition and segmentation. The task is often cast as a structured output problem on an exponentially large output-space, which is typically modeled by a discrete probabilistic model. The best segmentation is found by inferring the Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) solution over the output distribution defined by the model. Due to limitations in optimization, the model cannot be arbitrarily complex. This leads to a trade-off: devise a more accurate model that incorporates rich high-order interactions between image elements at the cost of inaccurate and possibly intractable optimization OR leverage a tractable model which produces less accurate MAP solutions but may contain high quality solutions as other modes of its output distribution. This thesis investigates the latter and presents a two stage approach to semantic segmentation. In the first stage a tractable segmentation model outputs a set of high probability segmentations from the underlying distribution that are not just minor perturbations of each other. Critically the output of this stage is a diverse set of plausible solutions and not just a single one. In the second stage, a discriminatively trained re-ranking model selects the best segmentation from this set. The re-ranking stage can use much more complex features than what could be tractably used in the segmentation model, allowing a better exploration of the solution space than simply returning the MAP solution. The formulation is agnostic to the underlying segmentation model (e.g. CRF, CNN, etc.) and optimization algorithm, which makes it applicable to a wide range of models and inference methods. Evaluation of the approach on a number of semantic image segmentation benchmark datasets highlight its superiority over inferring the MAP solution.},
