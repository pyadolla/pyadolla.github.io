abstract: Much effort has been directed at algorithms for obtaining the highest probability
  (MAP) configuration in probabilistic (random field) models. In many situations,
  one could benefit from additional high-probability solutions. Current methods for
  computing the M most probable configurations produce solutions that tend to be very
  similar to the MAP solution and each other. This is often an undesirable property.
  In this paper we propose an algorithm for the Diverse M-Best problem, which involves
  finding a diverse set of highly probable solutions under a discrete probabilistic
  model. Given a dissimilarity function measuring closeness of two solutions, our
  formulation involves maximizing a linear combination of the probability and dissimilarity
  to previous solutions. Our formulation generalizes the M-Best MAP problem and we
  show that for certain families of dissimilarity functions we can guarantee that
  these solutions can be found as easily as the MAP solution.
